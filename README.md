# Covid ICU Bed Allocation System

As a part of our [Data 200](https://ds100.org/) course, we aim to design a novel ranking system that can be used in hospitals during COVID outbreaks to prioritize providing care to patients at a higher risk level.
Using data provided by CDC, we create a model that assesses a patient's risk level based on their age, sex, and existing health conditions.
